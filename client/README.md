### About this repository
This repository contains code created while practicing building React UI application that works with REST API backend. Redux is used for state management, Redux Query is used to fetch data from REST API.

The implemented application is a book list where user can login, do CRUD operations with books he created, search books, add/remove from favorites list. 

Application has almost all typical UI elements that a web page can have: dropdown menu, modal dialog, a settings menu that can be
activated by control icon, multiple list items selection functionality, page has search form which displays results in dynamic way. There are data sending indicators, data sending failure messages. Design is responsive on all devices. Accessibility also is concerned - all interactive elements are highlighted when page elements are
navigated using TAB key.\
A component was created that lets easily generate HTML form by defining it's structure using array of objects.
